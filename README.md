Materials Resource Registry
===========================

Access to scientific data and resources across the materials community is limited and fragmented. Local resource providers are frequently populated with new resources but the larger community is often unaware that these potentially interesting resources are available. The NIST Materials Resource Registry bridges the gap between existing resources and the end users by registering the resources and their metadata for search and discovery. Resource providers would use the software to register their resources' descriptive metadata, access, and communication protocol for search and retrieval. The software, functioning as a comprehensively located service, would then make the registered information available for lookup to the materials community.

This software was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

The XML-based schemas provided with the Materials Resource Registry are examples of schemas that may be written to represent different aspects of materials data and to demonstrate some of the features that may be used within an XML schema. The schemas do not represent “standard” metadata representations and are specifically release as “as is,” and as such NIST makes no warrant of any kind on the correctness or accuracy of the content of the schemas, nor the fitness of the schemas for any purpose and accepts any liability or responsibility for the consequences of the schemas use or misuse by anyone.
