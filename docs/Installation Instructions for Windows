pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
2)	Add environment variable (Win 7 :Start, right click on Computer, Properties, click on Advance system settings in the left panel, go to advanced tab, Environment Variables…, New)
WORKON_HOME=%USERPROFILE%\Develop\Envs
3)	In a command prompt and then :
mkdir %WORKON_HOME%
cd %WORKON_HOME%
mkvirtualenv mgi
4)	To use the environment:
workon mgi (the prompt will change and become mgi. You should always see the mgi prompt when installing new packages)
